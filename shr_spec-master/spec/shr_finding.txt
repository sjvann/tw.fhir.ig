//----------- Class-Keyed Findings ---------------------

Abstract Element:	SpecializedFinding
Based on:		Finding
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The base class for conditions, allergies, risks, etc. The type/topic of the finding is given by the concept code for the class. For example, for Condition, the finding represents a 'condition present' finding, while the Value represents the type of condition found. For this reason, a separate ObservationCode is not required for descendants of SpecializedFinding."

		Value:			CodeableConcept from ValueAbsentReasonVS
		
		Element:		ObservationCode
		Concept:		MTH#C1706203
		Description:	"A code that represents what the finding concerns, for example, the subject's height, blood pressure, disease status, wound dimensions, diabetes risk, etc. Although named ObservationCode, in different contexts the same attribute might be more naturally referred to as a property, observable, or test code. In assertions (observations without an explicit question), the observation code is defaulted to a value representing 'assertion'."
		Value:			CodeableConcept 


		Element:		ClinicallyRelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the finding addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question.

		Element:		ObservationQualifier
		Concept:		MTH#C1443279
		Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		
		Element:		ReferenceRange
		Concept:		MTH#C0883335

				Element:	ApplicableAgeRange
				Concept:	TBD

		Element:		Members
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Members represent the elements of a group of a related but independent observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself."
		// Lloyd McKenzie said "has-member is for things like panels. For example, a CBC (complete blood count) would have members capturing white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, etc.  See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/search/cbc "

Based on:		Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1301625 "Assertion"
Description:	"A unary observation, also known as an assertion, is an observation that takes the form of a single code, without an explicit question or property. Examples include reported symptoms such as 'chest pain' and facts such as 'patient bed in low position'. Assertions may be negated setting the NegationFlag to true. The ObservationCode is defaulted to 'assertion' since assertions have no explicit question. Assertions cannot have a ValueAbsentReason, because Assertions without the asserted value are meaningless."

				ObservationCode is MTH#C1301625 "Assertion"

		Element:	NegationFlag
		Concept:	MTH#C1518422
		Description:	"A flag that indicates the meaning to be conveyed is the logical opposite of the current assertion. The assertion is negated only when the NegationIndicator is true. If absent or false, the assertion is not negated."

Based on:		Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1268086
