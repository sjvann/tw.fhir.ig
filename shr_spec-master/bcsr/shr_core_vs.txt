ValueSet: 				CodingQualifierVS
#preferred_code			"The preferred, standardized code for interoperability purposes. There should be only one coding in a CodeableConcept with this tag."
#source_code			"The code found in the information source for this entry, e.g., the raw, original, or first encoding."
#user_selected_code		"The code was directly selected by the user, as opposed to being determined after the fact via interpretation of notes or natural language processing."
#derived_code			"The code was determined after-the-fact from source data, either through translation, or via interpretation of free text (by human or machine)."
#category_code			"Indicates the code is a less specific term or a categorization of the source or standard code, i.e., a hypernym. For example, a code for 'vital sign' in the context of a body weight measurement would be a category code. Category codes can  be useful for search and query purposes."
#coded_expression		"The code is an expression in an expression language defined by the CodeSystem"
